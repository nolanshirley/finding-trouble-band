            Our Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our mission as the band Noise Complaint is to keep the spirit of rock alive. We believe that rock is not dead, but it is in a coma. We are here to make rock come to life. We are here to make rock fun again. We are here to make rock loud again!
